# Veriph.One Examples: React

Snippets and examples on how to use the Veriph.One SDK for your React projects. All projects included are as minimalistic as possible, using only bare bones React.

Each folder contains independent and standalone projects that cover specific use cases. Feel free to download only the folder you need or the whole repository if needed.

## Available Samples

1. Sign-up: A simple flow to capture a phone number safely for the first time, usually helpful for sign up, KYC, and onboarding processes.
2. Login / MFA: A verification process where you want a specific phone number (determined by your server) to be verified in order to continue with a transaction. It can be used for post-login multi-factor authentication or when executing sensitive operations in your web app.
